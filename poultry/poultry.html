While lots of people raise chickens, other fowl can also be very rewarding.

<p class="bird">
Even compared to chickens, guinea fowl are low-cost and low-maintenance, and do a standout job as chemical-free pest control.  Native to Africa, they are known for traveling in large, gregarious flocks.  Guinea fowl were introduced into Europe by 15th century Portuguese explorers, and then arrived in North America with the early settlers.  Guinea fowl meat is drier and leaner than chicken meat and has a gamey flavor.

<p class="bird">
Raising peafowl may seem “too exotic”, but it’s a fantastic hobby. 
Most peafowl are not what you would call tame. 
They tend to be fairly wild in temperament and are more difficult to keep than chickens. 
Peafowl come in a vast variety of colors from white to emerald. 
The easiest coloration to find is India Blue. 
Peafowl can live up to 40 years in captivity (zoos, breeding facilities, etc.), but only about 20 years in the wild.

<p class="bird">
Since wild pheasant stock fluctuates depending on weather and habitat suitability, private organizations and individuals raise these wild game birds for release in the autumn. If you've raised chickens, geese, or other poultry, pheasants are a whole new experience. They like their space and get cranky if there's not enough of it. In their natural habitat, pheasants like to hide in ground cover, so the birds will do better if the flyways are well-grown with grass, weeds or other cover.
